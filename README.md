# Movie Recommendation System | Python, Machine Learning, NLP



* Designed and developed a content-based movie recommendation system using Python to recommend movies similar to a user-selected movie.

* Used the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset, which contains detailed movie metadata, and worked with multiple CSV files to build the system.

* Performed data loading, merging, and cleaning to combine movie and credit information into a single usable dataset.

* Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns to improve data quality and reduce noise.

* Carefully selected important features such as movie genres, keywords, cast, crew, and plot overview that influence movie similarity.

* Extracted the director name from the crew data and limited cast information to the top actors to keep features meaningful.

* Converted complex JSON-like text fields into readable lists using Python functions and lambda expressions.

* Combined multiple text-based features into a single column to represent each movie in a unified way.

* Applied basic Natural Language Processing techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, and removal of extra spaces to standardize text data.

* Implemented the Bag of Words approach using CountVectorizer to convert textual information into numerical feature vectors.

* Controlled vocabulary size and removed common stop words to reduce dimensionality and improve similarity results.

* Used cosine similarity to calculate similarity scores between all movies based on their vector representations.

* Built a recommendation function that takes a movie title as input and returns the top most similar movies.

* Ensured the system handles edge cases such as invalid movie names by checking input before generating recommendations.

* Structured the code in a clear and logical way to improve readability and maintainability.

* Tested the recommendation output with multiple movie inputs to validate correctness and relevance of results.

* Focused on creating a simple and explainable recommendation logic instead of a black-box model.

* Gained hands-on experience with real-world machine learning workflows, from raw data to final output.

* Learned how recommendation systems work at a practical level and how similarity-based models are applied in industry.

* Designed the project so it can be extended into a web application using Streamlit or Flask for user interaction.

* Identified possible improvements such as using TF-IDF vectorization, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendation approaches.

* Understood the importance of feature selection and text preprocessing in improving recommendation quality.

* Improved Python programming skills, especially in data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy.

* Developed problem-solving and debugging skills while handling data inconsistencies and runtime errors.

* This project strengthened understanding of machine learning fundamentals and their real-world applications.
